#### CONTENTS
 The Shaders included here are mostly from the Unity Asset Store, i bought them and thought they would be great additions for ReShade, here's what it includes:
 - Darkbringer Retro Shader by Darkbringer: Uses LUTs based on old-game palettes and Dithering using PNG images. (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/darkbringer-retro-shader-57038)
 - Dithering Megapack by Grey Golem Studios: Similar to Darkbringer's Retro Shader, it also palettizes the image using old game palettes and applies dithering using PNG textures. (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/dithering-megapack-63982) (Removed from the Asset Store)
 - EasyVHS by Grey Golem Studios: A NTSC / CRT emulation shader. Contains code from MAME for the NTSC and other random sources for the rest of the effects. (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/easy-vhs-63898) (Removed from the Asset Store)
 - Graphics Adapter Pro by Vladimir Storm: A full-fledged shader designed to replicate old computer's colors, palettes, resolutions, video-modes and whatnot. Further modified to have more dithering options, support for image backgrounds, included even more palettes and also fully working with ReShade. (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/graphics-adapter-pro-55981)

#### CREDITS

 No credits taken for the code at all. Just for the ports. Also thanks for my mentors for helping me back at the day to port those.
 Maybe there will be more coming in the future soon! I still have a few others here but i gotta organize their textures in a way it doesn't clog my repository.
